Prerequisites
=============
You need to have Clam AV version 0.99.1 or above applied with patch from 
ClamWin  

You need to have PWCT 1.9(Art) which you can obtain from 
<http://doublesvsoop.sourceforge.net> or higher for building the GUI of the
program.

For building the Windows Executable from BAT scripts, You need to have Bat to Exe
converter developed by Fatih Kodak which you can obtain from <www.f2ko.de>

For building ClamSentinel Settings auto installer, You need to have 7-zip and 
the modified SFX Module developed by Oleg.

For creating the Installation Setup, You need to obtain the Inno Setup from
<http://www.jrsoftware.orh/isdl.php>

Installation
============
For easy installation, a binary package for Microsoft Windows has been uploaded
to SourceForge download area of the project.

If you wish to build the program from the source code, then read the following
instructions.

The first thing you need to build is the Clam AV antivirus using GCC.
Read more about compiling Clam AV Engine on <https://www.clamav.net>

Then build the executable of MicroStar Anti-Virus from the BAT script files using
Bat to Exe converter. Bat to exe is pretty straight forward application
and you can easily use it to make windows executable files from BAT scripts.

Then the next step is to build the GUI of the program. Compile the .ssf file 
from the folder GUI using PWCT.

Next step is to configure ClamSentinel to work with MicroStar Anti-Virus.
ClamSentinel depends on a .ini file located at %APPDATA%\Roaming\ClamSentinel
The file is located at the ini folder in the source tree and the file is 
commended wery well. You can easily edit the file according to your needs.
ClamSentinel also depends on ClamWin.conf which gives ClamSentinel the 
location of Clam AV engine and anti-virus database.

To create a setup program, open the setup folder in the source tree
and edit the setup_x86.iss file using Inno Setup.
(You can use ISTool or any other similar softwares to edit the file
easily)
