<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">The licenses for most software are
designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU
General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other
Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public
License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">When we speak of free software, we are
referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">To protect your rights, we need to make
restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to
surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">For example, if you distribute copies of
such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all
the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">We protect your rights with two steps: (1)
copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">Also, for each author's protection and
ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no
warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else
and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the
original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the
original authors' reputations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">Finally, any free program is threatened
constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors
of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">0. This License applies to any program or
other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The
"Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a
"work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
"you".<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">Activities other than copying,
distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside
its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output
from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
is true depends on what the Program does.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">1. You may copy and distribute verbatim
copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that
refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">You may charge a fee for the physical act
of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
exchange for a fee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">2. You may modify your copy or copies of
the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>* a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>* b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
this License.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>* c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
an announcement.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">These requirements apply to the modified
work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections
when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
and every part regardless of who wrote it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">Thus, it is not the intent of this section
to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative
or collective works based on the Program.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">In addition, mere aggregation of another work
not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work
under the scope of this License.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">3. You may copy and distribute the Program
(or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>* a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>* b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>* c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code
or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">The source code for a work means the
preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable
work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it
contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used
to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that
is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">If distribution of executable or object
code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to
copy the source along with the object code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense,
or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">5. You are not required to accept this
License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you
permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These
actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">6. Each time you redistribute the Program
(or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are
not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">7. If, as a consequence of a court
judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not
limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not
permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy
both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Program.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">If any portion of this section is held
invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the
section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in
other circumstances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">It is not the purpose of this section to
induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by
public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide
if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">This section is intended to make
thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
License.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">8. If the distribution and/or use of the
Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">9. The Free Software Foundation may
publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">Each version is given a distinguishing
version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">10. If you wish to incorporate parts of
the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two
goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">NO WARRANTY<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE
OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: black;">12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO
MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH
ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
